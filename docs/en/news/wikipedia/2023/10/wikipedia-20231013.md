## Gaza_Strip   
<p>The <b>Gaza Strip</b>, or simply <b>Gaza</b>, is a narrow piece of land located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordered by Israel to the east and north, and Egypt to the southwest. With a population of 2Â million, on some 365 square kilometers, Gaza, if considered a top-level political unit, ranks as the third most densely populated in the world. It is one of the two Palestinian territories, alongside the West Bank. Since 2007, the area has been governed by the political and militant Islamist group Hamas, and has been under blockade, leading human rights organizations to call it an "open-air prison".</p>   

## State_of_Palestine   
<p><b>Palestine</b>, officially the <b>State of Palestine</b>, is a state located in West Asia. The state claims the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as its territory, though the entirety of that territory has been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Palestine is currently recognized by 138 of the 193 United Nations member states. The West Bank is currently divided into 165 Palestinian enclaves that are under partial Palestinian rule, but the remainder, including 200 Israeli settlements, is under full Israeli control. The Gaza Strip is ruled by the militant group Hamas and has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since 2007.</p>
