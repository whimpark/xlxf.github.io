# XiaoLu School

An Internet learning space that keeps pace with the times.   

Learning in the Internet era is entirely for ourselves. The content we learn is what we need or are interested in. It is to solve the real problems we face, not for exams.   
As long as what we learn can solve problems, make us feel happy, and enrich our knowledge   

Learning in the Internet era requires us to possess three qualities:   
1. The ability to take the initiative to learn;   
2. The ability to find, distinguish and filter information;   
3. The ability to incorporate the learned knowledge into oneâ€™s own cognitive system.
